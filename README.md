# Web Linq Tool

This is a web-based tool that allows you to execute LINQ queries against JSON data. It uses Next.js for the frontend and Bun for the backend.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Gen AI API Key

To use the code generation feature, you will need to obtain an API key from a Gen AI provider. Please refer to the documentation of your chosen provider for instructions on how to obtain an API key.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
